# Twitter-Data-Analysis

### this is how I complete My Task

I Forked repository to my github account
I Created a branch called “fix_bug” to fix the bugs in the fix_clean_tweets_dataframe.py and fix_extract_dataframe.py 
In branch `fix_bug` copy or I renamed `fix_clean_tweets_dataframe.py` to `clean_tweets_dataframe.py` and `fix_extract_dataframe.py`  to `extract_dataframe.py` 
I Fix the bugs on `clean_tweets_dataframe.py` and `extract_dataframe.py` 
Multiple times I push the code that I am working on to git, and once the fix is complete, I merge the `fix_bug` branch to master
I Create a new branch called `make_unittest` for creating a new unit test for extract_dataframe.py code.
After completing the unit test writing, merge  “make_unittest”  to main branch
In all cases when you merge, make sure you first do Pull Request, review, then accept the merge.
I Setup Travis CI to my repository such that when I git push new code (or merge a branch) to the main branch, the unit test in tests/*.py runs automatically. then  All tests passed.

Have Fun and Cheers

thank you
